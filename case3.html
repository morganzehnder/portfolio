      <p class="col-sm-12 section mx-auto d-block"></br></br>During my survey and interview process users didn't mention a single food truck locator app that they currently used, though there are a few out there. In research and app reviews I came across Eat St/Roaming hunger most often, it is also a national food truck app (as opposed to some that are just regional). Since users I surveyed and interviewed were unable to shed light on food truck apps they liked/disliked, I focused more on what tools they prefer for discovery and ordering through applications for restaurants. Yelp was by far the most used discovery tool and UberEats the most used for ordering/delivery. Focusing on a very developed market will allow me to pull important qualities that are transferable to the food truck market.</p>

    <div class="row section-text">
      <p class="col-sm-12 section mx-auto d-block">When it came to  designing the logo for Wasted, I wanted to keep the design simple. Most women's clothing store logos stick to simple coloring, usually black. The lettering is typically a sans-serif font. I used popular online stores, such as Forever21, Urban Outfitters, Free People, and Zara as references since I am attempting to attract the same market as these stores - fashion forward 20 somethings. </br></br>However, my site is not exactly like these stores. If anything, Wasted is more modern and off-trend because it is a store full of recycled clothing. Waste is a thing of the past, Wasted is forward thinking and environmentally conscious without having to sacrifice edginess or selectiveness. </br></br>

Lastly, to hint at the consignment aspect of my store, I utilized a traditional recycle sign as the A.</br></br>I conducted a <span class="font-weight-bold">preference test </span>with my logo designs and <span class="font-weight-bold">the design below was selected 41/49 times</span>.
